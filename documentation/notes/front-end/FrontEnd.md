# Front End

## Notes

- swap screen as expected
- progress screen adjacent
- adnvaced screen adjacent again, with the following features:

1. auto-stream on/off // splitting the trades into a set number of streams, or enter manually
2. manually set gas // enter gas limit
3. manually set slippage // enter slippage limit
4. set rebalance latency thresholds // allow time for pools to rebalance if the same DEX returns desirable data
5. should a user's DEX preferences / custom DEX routes etc be modifyable? Initially I would think no but possibly in the future.
6. adjusting botGasFee // can set to be high to ensure tx throughput
