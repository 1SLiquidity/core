hit milestones

Tasks

- implement keeper
- design subgraph
- rapid draft ui for front end, including design layout, colour pallettes, background

Aim for Milestone 2

- have a fancy looking front end that features live prices for token inpiuts, with a wagmi (or other) skeleton to allow blockchain access.
