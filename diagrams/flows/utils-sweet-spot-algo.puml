  GD -> DEX: getReserves(tokenA, tokenB)
  DEX -> GD: Return current reserves
  GD -> GD: Calculate gas cost (G)
  GD -> GD: Extract reserve size (R)
  GD -> GD: Apply Sweet Spot Formula: N = V/sqrt(GÂ·R)
  GD -> GD: Check 2% depth cross comparison
  GD -> GD: Apply fee tier considerations
  GD -> GD: Determine final stream count
  GD -> GD: Calculate per-stream amount
  
  GD -> E: Return optimal stream count\nand per-stream amount
  deactivate GD
