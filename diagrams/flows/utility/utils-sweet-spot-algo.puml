database "DEXs" as DEX

User -> UI: Enter trade amount
UI -> UI: Initial client-side\nsweet spot estimation
User -> UI: Confirm trade
UI -> R: Submit trade request

group "Sweet Spot Calculation"
  R -> C: Forward trade datas
  C -> E: 
  E -> SD: checkSweetSpot(pairId, V)
  activate GD
  
  SD -> DEX: getReserves(tokenA, tokenB)
  DEX -> SD: Return current reserves
  SD -> SD: Calculate gas cost (G)
  SD -> SD: Extract reserve size (R)
  SD -> SD: Apply Sweet Spot Formula:\nN = V/sqrt(GÂ·R)
  SD -> SD: Check 2% depth cross comparison
  SD -> SD: Apply fee tier considerations
  SD -> SD: Determine final stream count
  SD -> SD: Calculate per-stream amount
  
  SD -> E: Return optimal stream count\ndestination DEX and per-stream amount
  deactivate SD
end

E -> E: Apply sweet spot to\ntrade parameters
E <-> DEX: Execute trade
C -> UI: Return trade confirmation
